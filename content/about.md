# Hello. I'm fred.

I'm a software developper, I live in Paris and I'm the author of [binjr](https://www.binjr.eu). 

I'm obviously a great many things beside that, but that's probably all the wider Internet cares to know about me anyway.

 As my relationship with social media outlets ranges from a complete lack of interest to a profound aversion, this site and my [github repositories](https://github.com/fthevenet) pretty much sum up the entirety of my presence on the Internet; if you find something else lying out there with my name on it (facebook, linkedin, twitter, etc...), it probably belongs to someone else. Please return it to its rightfull owner.

 Thank you for your time.

 Bye.
