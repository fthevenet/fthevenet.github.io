      <description>Hello. I&amp;rsquo;m fred. I&amp;rsquo;m a software developper, I live in Paris and I&amp;rsquo;m the author of binjr.
I&amp;rsquo;m obviously a great many things beside that, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably all the wider Internet cares to know about me anyway.
As my relationship with social media outlets ranges from a complete lack of interest to a profound aversion, this site and my github repositories pretty much sum up the entirety of my presence on the Internet; if you find something else lying out there with my name on it (facebook, linkedin, twitter, etc&amp;hellip;), it probably belongs to someone else.</description>
